      <p>My name is Eli Bresler and I was born on December 13, 1994 in San Francisco, California. I moved to
        Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when I was 14 and decided to go to college in Colorado. Now I'm back living in San
        Francisco, after a long and epic journey westward from the City of Brotherly Love. Asside from becoming a
        rockstar web developer, I spend my time playing soccer, cooking, and hanging out with friends.</p>

      <p>This is a really short and weird paragraph to write about myself and I have completely run out of things to
        say. At this point, I'm just going to let you click around and see if you like my first site! I hope you enjoy
        my portfolio of my favorite Tottenham Hotspur players (best team in the world... COME ON YOU SPURS!)</p>
